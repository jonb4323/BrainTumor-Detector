# BrainTumor-Detector
This project applies a basic supervised machine learning algorithms like linear regression and gradient descent to classify brain tumor images using a custom-built linear regression model. It includes image preprocessing, training a model via gradient descent, and visualizing predictions

Dependencies:
numpy,
PIL (Python Imaging Library via Pillow),
matplotlib,
random,
os

Model Training:
Initializes weights and bias,
Trains using gradient descent to minimize Mean Squared Error,
Logs cost and accuracy every 100 epochs

Visualization:
Displays a few randomly selected images with predicted labels
